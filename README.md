# Gridworld-Passive-BCI-Experiment
This is a collection of files to train and run a passive BCI experiment in which observing agents generate prediction error to correlate the magnitude with the human's event-related potential.

Module Requirements:\
numpy, pickle, pygame, matplotlib, seaborn

Training Agents:\
Run the file "train_agents.py"

Experiment:\
Run the file "run_experiment_vis.py" for a visual experiment\
Run the file "run_experiment.py" for a non-visual experiment to test accuracy of agent/s

Observation Prediction Error Generation:\
Run the file "run_agents_observation.py"

Note: To conduct experiment with EEG, a port system should be set up with trigger codes relaying information at the hunter's step.
